# Canvas 

That's just a thing i made using the canvas <br>
Actually, this came from a tutorial from 'Chris Courses'<br>
His <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Yp2yz6-pwhQuPlIDV_mjA">youtube</a></strong>channel</br>

But i added modules to the project, just for challenge my self a little bit

# Run this

To run this, just open the 'index.html' on a browser<br>

I used webPack in this project, so if you change something, you need to rebuild the bundle<br>
For that run ''npm install' to geu all dependences for the project(webpack)<br>
Then run 'npm run bundle'
